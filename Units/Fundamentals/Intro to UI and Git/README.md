# Intro to UI and Git  
The next two weeks will get you used to the wonderful world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Once you're done with these eight weeks, you'll be ready to build a website from scratch. 

## Three P's
### Prep
- Lambda [training kit materials](https://learn.lambdaschool.com/fsw/sprint/recfwZvI7QhMa7xbG).

### Practice
- Get more reps in getting to know CSS selectors with [CSS Dinner](http://flukeout.github.io/).  

### Play 
- [HTML can do that?](https://dev.to/ananyaneogi/html-can-do-that-c0n)

## What I wish I knew before this Unit 
- Day two, the inline-block styling unit, was one of my hardest. It will lay an important foundation for you to understand why flexbox is important (next day), but don't worry if it's a tough one. 
- I also wish I had done this very simple [Github tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

## Code review rubric 
_In addition to filling out these rubrics, I'll also record feedback on our pull request based off the blockers and goals you share with me._ 

### Project 1: Sweet Eats HTML + CSS markup 
- [Boilerplate HTML project](https://codepen.io/lambdaschool/pen/vaKejB)
- [Boilerplate CSS project](https://codepen.io/lambdaschool/pen/vaXWWG/?editors=0100)

#### HTML 
[] Used markup to give the plain content meaning. 
[] HTML tags make sense (e.g. the <p> tag is not used where a <li> would be more appropriate).
[] Can talk through at least one decision they made around tags.

#### CSS markup 
[] Final result matches Lambda's [final product](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/44f6a520-b218-4ed1-910b-f4dc876cd1a6_sweet-eats-home-page.png).
[] Can walk me through one CSS decision they made. 
[] Can explain one new term they learned from Googling. 

### Project 2: 'Great Idea!' page
-Project [Github repo](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/User-Interface) 

[] Final project closely matches Lambda's design files. 
[] Can walk me through at least one piece of code they chose to achieve that goal. 
[] Best practices: code is adequately commented with frequent, descriptive commits; it's readable!
[] Stretch: new nav bar color, font family, page, background image, and/or CSS animations attempted. 

### Project 3: 'Great Idea!' page, now with flexbox 
- Project [Github repo](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/UI-III-Flexbox)

[] Final project closely matches Lambda's design files. 
[] Can walk me through how at least one piece of flexbox code made yesterday's code obsolete. 
[] Best practices: code is adequately commented with frequent, descriptive commits; it's readable!
[] Stretch: new page, or media queries attempted. 

### Project 4: Git for Web development 
- Project [Github repo](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Git-for-Web-Development-Project)

[] Follows proper git workflow to fork, clone, and PR project repo. 
[] Follows same git workflow for previous projects. 
[] Can chat through the steps of that workflow. 

## Sprint Challenge code review 
- Sprint [Github repo](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Sprint-Challenge--User-Interface)

[] Best practices: code is adequately commented with frequent, descriptive commits; it's readable, and proper git workflow followed. 
[] Home page matches design files.
    [] Navigation appears. 
    [] Header appears. 
    [] Boxes accurately styled. 
[] Can walk me through how code made files match, sharing at least one concrete programming decision. 
[] About page matches design files. 
    [] Navigation and header match Home page. 
    [] Header image has About page image. 
    [] Home navigation links back to index. 
[] Can walk me through how code made files match, sharing at least one concrete programming decision. 
[] Stretch attempted
    [] Extra page.
    [] Some CSS animations. 
    [] Contact page with a form. 
    [] Responsive breakpoints with media queries.

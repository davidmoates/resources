# Intro to UI and Git  
The next two weeks will get you used to the wonderful world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Once you're done with these eight weeks, you'll be ready to build a website from scratch. 

## Three P's
### Prep
- Lambda [training kit materials](https://learn.lambdaschool.com/fsw/sprint/recfwZvI7QhMa7xbG).

### Practice
- Get more reps in getting to know CSS selectors with [CSS Dinner](http://flukeout.github.io/).  

### Play 
- [HTML can do that?](https://dev.to/ananyaneogi/html-can-do-that-c0n)

## What I wish I knew before this Unit 
- Day two, the inline-block styling unit, was one of my hardest. It will lay an important foundation for you to understand why flexbox is important (next day), but don't worry if it's a tough one. 
- I also wish I had done this very simple [Github tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

## Code review rubric 
### Project 1: Sweet Eats HTML + CSS markup 
- [Boilerplate HTML project](https://codepen.io/lambdaschool/pen/vaKejB)
- [Boilerplate CSS project](https://codepen.io/lambdaschool/pen/vaXWWG/?editors=0100)

#### HTML 
[] Used markup to give the plain content meaning. 
[] HTML tags make sense (e.g. the <p> tag is not used where a <li> would be more appropriate).
[] Student can talk through at least one decision they made around tags.

#### CSS markup 
[] Student's final result matches Lambda's [final product](https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/44f6a520-b218-4ed1-910b-f4dc876cd1a6_sweet-eats-home-page.png).
[] Student can walk me through one CSS decision they made. 
[] Student can explain one new term they learned from Googling.

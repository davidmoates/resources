## Meeting types

### Team standups 
Weâ€™ll generally cover three things: 1) What did you accomplish today? 2) What do I need to finish before tomorrow? 3) What blockers am I having? These should take no more than half an hour of your time. Once everyone covers those, we'll close out with one thing we're excited about, maybe even outside of Lambda. 

### Project and Sprint code reviews 
We'll go over how things are going and how you're feeling. Then I'll ask you to walk through your projects, identifying how you met the objectives. A good structure for this could be, "Here is what I had to do (objectives). Here is how I did it." 

Then, we'll go over blockers, where you feel confident, and what you'd like to focus on. I'll give you two pieces of feedback based on what you share there and our objectives for the unit, and I'll also ask you to come up with a goal for the remainder of the unite. 

We'll close with a recap and any outstanding questions.

# Kimberleeâ€™s Weekly 5:15s

----------------------------------------------------------

General definition: 5:15s should take no more than 15 minutes to write and no more than 5 minutes to read.

Purpose: To keep my Lambda community informed of what I'm working on, so everyone can help hold me accountable. Ideally, it will spark conversations and feedback and general improvement.

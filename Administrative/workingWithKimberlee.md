Working with Kimberlee

Personality type 
According to 16 Personalities: Advocate
According to Harry Potter: Slytherpuff 

What does that mean? 
Strengths: I am action-oriented, but those actions are almost always tied to a big dream or purpose. I’m happiest when I’m doing mission-focused work, and I’m very happy that my purpose over the next few months is to help you succeed at Lambda School. I tend to be driven by helping people solve problems, and I do my best to listen. 

Weaknesses: I might need a heads-up if you’re looking to vent about a problem and need a good listener, but not necessarily an immediate solution. Since I’m so goals-oriented, if I’m not careful I can be and do a bit too much, like that new Carly Rae song. I need to keep a careful eye out for my own burnout in order to avoid that. I manage my energy through a few tools that work for me: mediation, exercise, and reading (find me on Goodreads!). 

How I communicate 
I’m honest and direct, and I ask for the same from everyone in my life. One of the things that frustrates me most is inauthenticity (ask me about my previous life in public relations, lol). 
It’ll be easiest to get a hold of me during Lambda hours on Slack. 
Outside of Lambda hours, if you need to urgently get a hold of me you should reach out in the following order: 
Slack: @kimberlee
Text or call: Check our channel for my number in Slack

What you can expect from me
Standups: We’ll generally cover three things: 1) What did you accomplish today? 2) What do I need to finish before tomorrow? 3) What blockers am I having? These should take no more than half an hour of your time. 
Code reviews: I’ll ask you to walk me through what you built and how. 
Sprint reviews: These will be very similar to our code reviews, but we’ll also talk at a higher-level about how the overall week went. 
Availability. If you need additional resources from Lambda, whether those are flex or otherwise, I will help you find them. I will show up for you. 
Transparency: I’m keeping track of my goals and what I’m working on in my 5:15, and feel free to add things. 
I will make time for you! I’m a fellow student and your partner in this journey and am here for whatever you need, whether that’s our regular meetings or advice about something else. 
I will follow the Lambda School Code of Conduct outlined in our Student User Manual and also the Team Lead Code of Conduct. 
If I’m falling short on any of these, I will listen to you point it out to me, apologize, and fix it. 

What I expect from you
The Student User Manual really covers it all!
